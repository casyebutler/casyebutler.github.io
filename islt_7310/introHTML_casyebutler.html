My name is Casye Butler. I was born and raised in Saint Louis, Missouri. I am the youngest of nine children. I have four brothers and four sisters. I have two girls, whom I call my Twin Towers, Gabrielle is 16 and Leigha is 13, although they are not twins, they are both taller than me. This is my 7th year teaching.  I have taught fourth grade for three years, second grade for two years. I am currently teaching third grade and I will loop with my students for the 2021-2022 school year. I earned my Masters in the Reading at Grand Canyon University and obtain my Special Reading certification.  I do not have any experience in web application or development. I expect to be able to know how to design a web page. Since I do not have any experience with web development, I want to learn as much as possible about web development. My favorite hobby is cheering my girls on the volleyball court.
